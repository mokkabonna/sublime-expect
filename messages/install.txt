These snippets will only work when the Syntax is set to the "JavaScript (Test)" syntax. This syntax is included.

This is to avoid too much completions showing up in regular javascript files.

Either you can manually change the syntax for the file to this syntax to enable the completions, 
or even better use the sublime package [ApplySyntax](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/ApplySyntax)

Then in your user setting for that package configure it like this (in this example all files end with `Spec.js`)

```json
{
    "syntaxes": [
        {
            "name": "Expect/JavaScript (Test)",
            "rules": [
                {"file_name": ".+Spec.js$"}
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
